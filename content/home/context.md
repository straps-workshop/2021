More than ever, reducing the cost of data integration by efficiently evaluating queries is an important challenge, given that today the economic cost in computing cycles (see your cloud invoice); and in energy consumption and the performance required for some critical tasks have become important. Besides, new applications require solving even more complex queries including millions of sources, and data with high levels of volume and variety. These challenges call for intelligent processes that can learn from previous experiences, that can be adaptable to changing requirements and dynamic execution contexts.

This workshop follows a first and second successful editions in conjunction with ICSOC 2019 in Toulouse, and ICSOC 2020 in Abu Dhabi (online) that led to vivid programs with interesting discussions (https://straps-workshop.github.io) and keynotes that provided reference on trend problems addressed in academia and industry around STRAPS topics. 

The third edition of the workshop STRAPS aims at promoting scientific discussion on the way data produced under different conditions can be efficiently integrated to answer simple, relational, analytical queries according to the following conditions: 
- These queries must cope to quality preferences associated with providers, algorithms and data trust. 

- New scales in volume, velocity and value associated with integrated data collections require adapted solutions providing computing, storage and processing services potentially deployed on different highly distributed infrastructures and target architectures. 

- With service, data and algorithms stemming from different and potentially huge numbers of providers, properties like provenance, quality and trust, arise as key properties to be quantified, evaluated and exposed to data consumers. How can data integration in such conditions be smart? This is the key question to be discussed by workshop participants.


##### OBJECTIVE

The workshop STRAPS aims at promoting scientific discussion on the way data stemming from different providers and produced under different conditions can be efficiently integrated to answer simple, relational, analytical queries ensuring providers, algorithms and data trust.
