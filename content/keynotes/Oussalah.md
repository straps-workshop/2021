##### Abstract

With the standardization of Electronic Health Records in hospitals and mandatory requirement for data preservation, healthcare data reached unprecedented scale and scope, offering both opportunities and challenges to practitioners, regulators and researchers. Community network analysis emerged as a promising trend and technology for mining large scale health dataset. In its simple form, social network analysis aims to identify communities of nodes that are similar to each other according to some similarity criteria. Nevertheless, the research gets widen when considering the various entities that can be assigned to nodes, ranging from named-entities (e.g., patients, organization, locations) to abstract structures inferred from original data, as well as  the potentially high number of attributes associated to a single node (i.e., age, gender, interest), which builds a bridge to the concept of “attributed community” that balances network topology with attribute similarity. This talk reviews the state-of-the art in this field of community-based mining in healthcare, highlighting the state-of-the-art, challenges and promising directions in the field. At the same time some ongoing works in the field as part of DigiHealth Oulu, will be scrutinized. Growing issues of explainability and computational affordability will be investigated.

Dr. Mourad Oussalah is a Research Professor in University of Oulu, Faculty of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, Centre for Machine Vision and Signal Analysis, where he leads the Social Mining Research Group. He is also affiliated with Medical Imaging, Physics and Technology Unit of the Faculty of Medicine as part of Academy of Finland DigiHealth Project. Prior joining University of Oulu, he was with the University of Birmingham, UK from 2003-2016. He also held research positions at City University of London and KU Leuven in Belgium, and Visiting Professor position in University of Evry Val Essonnes of France (summer 2006), New Mexico of USA (summer 2009) and Xian University of China (Fall 2018).

Dr. Oussalah research has concentrated mainly on information and data fusion, text mining, information retrieval and uncertainty handling where he published more than 250 international publications and supervised a dozen of PhD students and more than 40 Msc students, provided more than 20 keynote talks at international conferences and served as PC members of more than 60 international conferences.
He is a Fellow of Royal Statistical Society and Senior member of IEEE and acted as executive of IEEE SMC UK & Ireland Chapter from 2002 till 2016.

Dr. Oussalah is also leading and participating into several EU projects including YoungRes (#823701) (2019-2021) on Youth polarization, WaterLine (2021-2024) on Soil Moixture Analysis, Prince (#815362) (2019-2022) on CBRNE incidents, Cutler (#770469) on Coastal Urban development, IPaWa (2019-2022) on smart parking, CBC Karelia (Finland-Russia) on IoT Business Creation (2018-2020), Grage –Marie Skłodowska-Curie action (ID:645706) (2016-2018) on active ageing and elderly living in urban settings, COST Action on Linked Data. Academy of Finland DigiHealth (2020-2024). He also secured funding from several foundations (e.g., Finnish Cancer Research, Nokia and Nuffield foundations).
